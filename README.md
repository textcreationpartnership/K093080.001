He became a member of Queen's College, Oxford, in April 1701. On the 22d of February, 1708, he took the degree of M. A. and two years afterwards was choſen Fellow of his College. During his reſidence at the Univerſity, the Opera of Roſamond was performed, and on its appearance, Mr. Tickell addreſſed a Poem to Mr. Addiſon, the Author, which was ſo well received, that it laid the foundation of an intimacy between the two friends, and proved of the greateſt advantage to Mr. Tickell's future fortune. When Mr. Addiſon went to Ireland as Secretary to Lord Sunderland, Mr. Tickell accompanied him, and was employed in public buſineſs. In 1717, he became Under Secretary of State, and about 1725, was appointed Secretary to the Lords Juſtices of Ireland, a place of great honour, in the enjoyment whereof he continued until his death, which happened at Bath, on the 23d of April 1740.

    _ KENSINGTON GARDENThe Palace to which this Garden belongs, was the ſeat of Lord Chancellor Finch, afterwards Earl of Nottingham, and was purchaſed by King William, who greatly improved it, cauſing a royal road to be made to it through Saint James's and Hyde Parks. Queen Mary enlarged the Gardens; her ſiſter, Queen Anne, improved what Queen Mary had begun, and was ſo pleaſed with the place, that ſhe frequently ſupped during the Summer in the green houſe, which is a very beautiful one: but Queen Caroline was the perſon who compleated the deſign, by extending the Gardens from the great road in Kenſington to Acton; by bringing what is called the Serpentine river into them; and by taking in ſome acres out of Hyde Park, on which ſhe cauſed a mount to be raiſed.

    _ GRONGAR HILL. Near CAERMARTHEN, South Wales. By Mr. DYERMr. John Dyer was the ſecond ſon of Robert Dyer of Aberglaſney, in Caermarthenſhire, a ſolicitor of great capacity and note. He was born in the year 1700, and received his education at Weſtminſter-ſchool, from whence he returned home, being deſigned for his father's profeſſion. Diſliking the ſtudy of the law, he relinquiſhed it on the death of his parent, and having an inclination for painting, became a pupil to Mr. Richardſon. He then travelled into Italy, continued ſome time at Rome, and came back to England in 1740. His proficiency at an artiſt ſeems to have been but inconſiderable; and this circumſtance, joined to an ill ſtate of health, and the love of ſtudy, determined him to the church. He therefore entered into holy orders, and in 1741 obtained the living of Calthorp, in Leiceſterſhire, on which he lived ten years, and then exchanged it for Belchford, in Lincolnſhire. In 1752 he was preſented to the rectory of Coningſby, and ſoon after had that of Kirkby given him in addition. On the two latter he remained during the reſt of his life, which ended in July 1758, of a conſumptive diſorder, which he had ſtruggled with many years..

    _ THE SCHOOL-MISTRESS. A POEM, In IMITATION of SPENSER. By WILLIAM SHENSTONE, EſqWilliam Shenſtone, Eſq was born at the Leaſowes, in the pariſh of Hales Owen, and county of Salop, Nov. 1714. He was taught to read by the old dame whom he has delivered to poſterity in the preſent poem, after which, he went ſome time to the grammar-ſchool in Hales Owen, then to Mr. Crompton, an eminent ſchoolmaſter at Solihul, and in 1732 was entered a commoner of Pembroke College, Oxford. He continued his name at the Univerſity ten years, but took no degree, nor made the ſlighteſt effort to engage in any profeſſion. After ſpending a few years with great inattention to his fortune, and much to the injury of it, he, about the year 1745, went to reſide upon his eſtate, which he ornamented with ſo much taſte, that it became one of the chief objects of curioſity, to thoſe whom buſineſs or pleaſure called to that part of the kingdom. Unfortunately for Mr. Shenſtone, his income was not equal to the expence which his improvements demanded. He embarraſſed his circumſtances, and dragged out the latter part of his life diſcontentedly, and in diſtreſs. It is ſaid, that if he had lived a little longer, he would have been aſſiſted by a penſion, which death prevented him from enjoying. He died at the Leaſowes, of a putrid fever, about five on Friday morning, Feb. 11, 1763, and was buried in the churchyard of Hales Owen.

He was educated at Norwich ſchool, which he left in 1720, and went to Trinity College Cambridge, where Dr. Bentley, who had been private tutor to his father, was then Maſter. He became a candidate while there for a fellowſhip, but through the influence of Dr. Bentley, was rejected. On this diſappointment, he quitted the Univerſity, and travelled with Mr. Wyndham of Felbrig, in Norfolk, to whom this Poem is addreſſed, and with whom he lived in the moſt intimate and unreſerved friendſhip. By the favour of the late Lord Barrington, he was appointed maſter of the barracks at Kenſington, a place which enabled him to purſue his ſtudies, and particularly his favourite one of Natural Hiſtory, with ſucceſs. He was the author of ſeveral valuable works which have been publiſhed, and of others which have not hitherto appeared. He died a batchelor, in the year 1771, at the age of upwards of ſeventy years, and was buried in Saint James's church..

    _ ODE, to a LADY. On the Death of Col. CHARLES ROSS, in the Action at Fontenoy. Written May 1745. By Mr. W. COLLINSWilliam Collins was born at Chicheſter on the 25th day of December, about 1720. His father was a hatter. In 1733 he was admitted a ſcholar of Wincheſter college, and in 1740 ſtood firſt in the liſt of the ſcholars in ſucceſſion at New College; but there being no vacancy at that time, he became a commoner of Queen's College, and in about half a year after was elected a Demy of Magdalen College, where he continued until he had taken a Batchelor's degree, and then ſuddenly left the univerſity. This event happened about the year 1744. He immediately came to London, and commenced a literary adventurer; in which capacity he was not diligent enough to keep himſelf from want. In a ſhort time he was relieved from his diſtreſſes by the death of his uncle, Mr. Martin, a lieutenant colonel, who left him about £. 2,000. From this period his health began to decline, and he gradually fell into that ſtate of depreſſion of mind which enchains the faculties without deſtroying them, and leaves reaſon the knowledge of right without the power of purſuing it. Theſe clouds which he perceived gathering on his intellects, he endeavoured to diſperſe by travel, and paſſed into France; but found himſelf conſtrained to yield to his malady, and returned. He was for ſome time confined in a houſe of lunatics, and afterwards retired to the care of his ſiſter at Chicheſter, where death, in 1756, came to his relief..
